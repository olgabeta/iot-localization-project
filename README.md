# Localization Project

In this project, we were given a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and three BLE beacons. The task was to get the Pi coordinates based on its proximity to the three beacons (known positions) with the method of trilateration. Once the localization of the Pi was completed, we were asked to plot the coordinates of the Pi and the beacons, as well as optimize the trilateration results.
